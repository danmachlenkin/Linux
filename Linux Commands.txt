Text Editors - Vim and emacs are popular text editors that are installed by default on most Linux distributions and they both have their pros and cons:
   Vim commands:
    :w - writes or saves the file
    :q - quit out of vim
    :wq - write and then quit
    :q! - quit out of vim without saving the file
    ZZ - equivalent of :wq, but one character faster
    u - undo your last action
    Ctrl-r - redo your last action


User Management:
-sudo command - There is a file called the /etc/sudoers file, this file lists users who can run sudo
-Usernames aren't really identifications for users. The system uses a user ID (UID) to identify a user.
-To find out what users are mapped to what ID, look at the /etc/passwd file.
-User's password - the password is not really stored in /etc/passwd file, it's usually stored in the /etc/shadow file.
-User Management Tools:
 Most enterprise environments are using management systems to manage users, accounts and passwords. 
 However, on a single machine computer there are useful commands to run to manage users.
 The commands are: sudo useradd bob / sudo userdel bob / passwd bob
-Switch to the New User: After creating the new user, you need to switch to that user account. You can do this using the su (switch user) command followed by the username.

Permissions:
r: readable
w: writable
x: executable (basically an executable program)
-: empty
-Changing permissions can easily be done with the chmod command: (chmod u+x myfile / chmod 755 myfile)
-Modify user ownership:

$ sudo chown patty myfile
This command will set the owner of myfile to patty.

-Modify group ownership:

$ sudo chgrp whales myfile
This command will set the group of myfile to whales.
